She explains her diverse heritage, connecting to the Lama Lama, Wakawaka, and Birri Gaba peoples of Australia and the Ngāti Porou and Ngāti Kahungunu peoples of New Zealand.  Kaydee shares her passion for makeup, recalling how she was drawn to it from a young age, even facing criticism for expressing her creativity through makeup and hairstyles in school. The conversation then shifts to the lack of representation in the beauty industry. Kaydee recounts her experience during her makeup diploma where she observed a significant lack of shade diversity and limited curriculum time dedicated to darker complexions and textured hair.  She expresses her determination to challenge these norms and raise awareness about the need for greater inclusivity.
